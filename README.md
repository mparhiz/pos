# Vending Machine (POS)
This project is a simple software solution to model the operation of a POS.
I used the HttpClient to make HTTP requests and mocking a product list as a JSON file.
I used the NgRx for state management and localstorage to store data.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Running app

Run `ng serve -o` to run the application. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.
